# Reflection: My Data Explorer

## Were your predictions right?
Yes, I correctly predicted that Wednesday had the most screen time. I also expected Thursday or Sunday to have the best focus, and that was true based on focus levels.

## What surprised you?
I expected that more caffeine would help with focus, but the data showed that lower caffeine days actually had better focus scores.

## What was tricky or rewarding?
Writing the mood frequency function was a bit tricky at first, but it felt rewarding to see it print the correct most frequent mood. The correlation logic for caffeine and focus was also fun to explore.

## How did using your own data change things?
Using realistic data made the project more meaningful and interesting. It felt personal and helped me understand how simple code can give insights into everyday behavior.
